##  How to run Files in SAGE environment
- We suggest using `Cocalc` to get an environment already set up with SAGE. You may work with Cocalc anonymously, but we recommend Signing Up as it saves your work.
- Also, Cocalc may not have the best interface. So, after you Sign Up, you may follow the below steps which I usually follow to get a familiar interface (JuypterLab) which I guess we all love:
- `Sign In` → `Projects` → `Create New Project` → `Start Project` → `Settings` → `JupyterLab Notebook Server`
- Following the above steps will open a new tab with your familiar JupyterLab interface.
- OR you can directly use https://sagecell.sagemath.org/
